A Max Package for experiments in granular synthesis. The petra package will replace the [cm.grainlabs~](https://github.com/CircuitMusicLabs/cm.grainlabs) object, which is no longer in development and likely to cause crashes with all current versions of Max.

petra is still in active development, but I'm applying the last touches since all contained objects seem to be stable.

You're welcome to come back here to check for updates. I will try to submit the project as an official Max package for the new [Max Package Manager](https://cycling74.com/2015/12/14/introducing-the-max-package-manager/#.V6BINKJ1Z_B) as soon as all is done and tested.
