**Note:**
petra is in active development, so any of the existing branches might be unstable or contain incomplete code. If you're interested in the compiled external objects only, please download the latest release [here](https://github.com/CircuitMusicLabs/petra/releases).

petra is a is a collection of external audio objects neatly packed into a Package for Max by [Cycling '74](https://cycling74.com/). It is used for polyphonic granulation of pre-recorded sounds. The package is loosely based on the principle of asynchronous granular synthesis (outlined in Curtis Roads' book [Microsound](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/microsound)). The objects are made for sample precision granulation of both single- and dual-channel audio files.

In addition, petra contains an audio object for live input granulation. It makes use of a circular buffer and an adjustable, and optionally randomised, delay control over the duration of the entire buffer.

All objects share the following controls, which consist of an upper and lower range, from within which a random value is generated for each grain:

* start position within the selected sample buffer~ object
* grain length
* grain pitch
* panorama position per grain
* gain per grain

petra is now open for beta-testing. Feel free to download and to report back any feedback you may have.

Once beta testing is done, I will try to submit the project as an official Max package for the new [Max Package Manager](https://cycling74.com/2015/12/14/introducing-the-max-package-manager/#.V6BINKJ1Z_B).

## System Requirements for Compiled Externals
* Mac OS 10.9.5 or above or Microsoft Windows 7 or later
* Max 6.1.8 or above (compatible with Max 7)
* Max 32 bit and 64 bit

## Installing the Source Code
### Prerequisites
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* XCode (Mac Os)
* Visual Studio (Windows)

### Cloning the Repository
Clone the petra repository via the Terminal using the following commands:

	cd ~/yourdirectory
	git clone https://github.com/CircuitMusicLabs/petra

After you cloned the repository, you have to pull the contents of the Max SDK submodule with the following commands:

	cd petra
	git submodule update --init --recursive

### Compiling the External Objects (Mac OS)
Go to ~/yourdirectory/petra/source, open the included Xcode projects and compile the externals with via Product > Build (Command-B).

### Compiling the External Objects (Windows)
Currently, the repository does not contain preconfigured project files for Visual Studio on Windows. Apparently, managing the locations of the Max SDK include-files is not as straight forward.

The easiest way to compile the petra external objects on Windows is the following (cm.buffercloud~ object serving as an example):

1. Go to ~/yourdirectory/petra/max-sdk/source/audio
2. Duplicate any one of the project folders (e.g. simplemsp~) and rename this folder into cm.buffercloud~ (do not move)
3. Enter the cm.buffercloud~ folder and rename the ~.vcxproj file and the ~.c source file into cm.buffercloud~
4. Open the ~.vcxproj file with Visual Studio
5. Replace the contents of the ~.c source file with the contents of the cm.buffercloud~.c source file contained in ~/yourdirectory/petra/source/cm.buffercloud~
6. Build both Release|Win32 and Release|x64 build configurations

After building, the compiled externals can be found in ~/yourdirectory/petra/max-sdk/externals

## Installation of the Max Package
The petra repository is structured as a Max package, which contains the compiled external objects.

#### Installing the Max Package (Max 6 - Mac OS X)
Copy the entire petra repository either into the "packages" folder in your Max installation or into "Max/Packages" in your ~/Documents folder.

#### Installing the Max Package (Max 7 - Mac OS X)
Copy the entire petra repository into “Max 7/Packages" in your ~/Documents folder.

#### Installing the Max Package (Max 7 - Windows)
Copy the entire petra repository into “Max 7/Packages" in your ~/Documents folder.

## How to use petra
After installing the Max package, open the [petra_overview.maxpat](https://github.com/CircuitMusicLabs/petra/blob/master/extras/petra_overview.maxpat) file. I contains the entire documentation and links to all object helpfiles.
